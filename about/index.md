<p>
Born in one of the Tollans. When I was a kid, I wanted to be an FX artist to play with robots. Now I build them for real.

I despise misspellings, albeit I am sinner myself. Bein a dog person, I am still hesitant to be responsible for any living creature. Thus, even my cacti die.

This site is to share what I find interesting and/or helpful about Robotics, AI, Engineering or anything around those lines.
