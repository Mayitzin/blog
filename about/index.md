<p>
A self-declared taco connoisseur and Weisswurst enthusiast, I’m a simple guy living in Munich and an official Roboticist according to the Technical University of Munich, although I do it for the love of our knowledge.

<p>
Enchanted by History (most of all from Western Europe and Latin America), I always set my mind free while traveling and discovering new cultures, or food.

I think you don’t need to know any little details about me besides the things you can discover reading my lines. This site is to share mainly interesting and/or helpful technical tricks on Robotics, AI and Tech in odd places.
