<p>
Born in one of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/T%C5%8Dll%C4%81n">Tollans</a>, I became the class clown early in my life, while brewing a big desire to be an FX artist and play with robots. Now I build the real ones.

<p>
I loathe misspellings, albeit I am sinner myself. Sleeping is an unnecessary human trait for me. I've been having fun in the fields of Electronics, Robotics, Education, <a href="https://www.gruenderszene.de/allgemein/vibewrite-insolvenzverschleppung-anzeige">failed<a/>, <a href="https://www.konux.com/">successful</a> and <a href="https://www.inne.io/">running</a> Startups, and <a href="http://userpage.fu-berlin.de/~tapia/?page_id=39">Autonomous Driving</a>. I do all that, because it's exciting.

<p>
When I'm not playing the roboticist life, I can be found <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/16934980-mario-garc-a">reading history books</a>, having a drink with my pals in a Biergarten, <a href="https://letterboxd.com/mayitzin/">watching tons of films</a>, <a href="https://mayitzin.com/">rambling about politics</a>, or <a href="https://www.youtube.com/user/Mayitzin">babbling in Youtube</a>.

A summarized timeline of my experience can be seen in my <a href="../assets/pdf/CV.pdf">CV</a>.

This site is to share what I find interesting and/or helpful about Robotics, AI, Engineering or anything around those lines.
